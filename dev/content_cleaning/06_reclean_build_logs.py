# Re-clean existing issue MDs with strip_build_logs() — build/install-tool log noise pass
# (setuptools/distutils output, pip/conda install output, compiler invocations + diagnostics,
# VCS clone output), safe on already-formatted MDs (does not touch title/metadata, only replaces
# matched build-log spans with a one-line placeholder). Dry-run by default; --apply overwrites in
# place after a timestamped backup — the corpus is gitignored, so the backup is the only safety
# net. Refuses to write anything (report or corpus) if the safety assertion fails.

# Hard safety exclusion — a line matching any of these is NEVER classified as removable and NEVER

# "warning", genuine content the reporter/maintainer wrote. Project premise: content and context
# have absolute priority, we only ever remove pure noise, and a warning is content, never noise,
# even sitting inside an otherwise-disposable pip/build run. Added 2026-09-05 after
# MinerU__1418.md's "WARNING: magic-pdf 0.6.1 does not provide the extra 'full'" was found bridged
# over between Downloading/Requirement-already-satisfied lines — see process-docs/content_cleaning/.
