REST API endpoints for issues

Use the REST API to manage issues and pull requests.
List issues assigned to the authenticated user

List issues assigned to the authenticated user across all visible repositories including owned repositories, member repositories, and organization repositories. You can use the filter query parameter to fetch issues that are not necessarily assigned to you.

Note

GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

    application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
    application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include body_text.
    application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include body_html.
    application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include body, body_text, and body_html.

Fine-grained access tokens for "List issues assigned to the authenticated user"

List organization issues assigned to the authenticated user

List issues in an organization assigned to the authenticated user.

Note

GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

    application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
    application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include body_text.
    application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include body_html.
    application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include body, body_text, and body_html.

List repository issues

List issues in a repository. Only open issues will be listed.

Note

GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

    application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
    application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include body_text.
    application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include body_html.
    application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include body, body_text, and body_html.

Fine-grained access tokens for "List repository issues"

This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:

Get an issue

The API returns a 301 Moved Permanently status if the issue was transferred to another repository. If the issue was transferred to or deleted from a repository where the authenticated user lacks read access, the API returns a 404 Not Found status. If the issue was deleted from a repository where the authenticated user has read access, the API returns a 410 Gone status. To receive webhook events for transferred and deleted issues, subscribe to the issues webhook.

Note

GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

    application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
    application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include body_text.
    application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include body_html.
    application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include body, body_text, and body_html.

Fine-grained access tokens for "Get an issue"

This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:

    GitHub App user access tokens
    GitHub App installation access tokens
    Fine-grained personal access tokens

The fine-grained token must have the following permission set:

This endpoint can be used without authentication or the aforementioned permissions if only public resources are requested.

Note

GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

    application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
