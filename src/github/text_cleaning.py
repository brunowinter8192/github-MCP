# Run-length threshold: minimum consecutive block length (lines) to qualify as a removable build
# log, plus the max consecutive non-signal/non-blank/non-protected filler lines bridged inside an
# open run (wrapped compiler diagnostic messages, source-context lines). A block only ever starts
# and ends ON a matched signal line, never on bridged filler. Values measured against the
# 844-file github_issues corpus; see process-docs/content_cleaning/.

# Hard safety exclusion — a line matching any of these is NEVER classified as removable and NEVER
# bridged over. These are the retrieval target of the document (the actual failure) — or, for
# "warning", genuine content the reporter/maintainer wrote. Project premise: content and context
# have absolute priority, we only ever remove pure noise, and a warning is content, never noise,
# even sitting inside an otherwise-disposable pip/build run. Added 2026-09-05 after
# MinerU__1418.md's "WARNING: magic-pdf 0.6.1 does not provide the extra 'full'" was found bridged
# over between Downloading/Requirement-already-satisfied lines — see process-docs/content_cleaning/.

# ("path:line:col: 0xADDR in func") — protected even though they don't literally contain an
# error-indicator word. Without this, caret/underline diagnostic markers can bridge straight
# across real traceback frames and delete the crash location. See process notes.

# Vocabulary: line-start / structural anchors for machine-generated build & install output.
# Deliberately loose (single verbs, generic phrases) — safety comes from the run-length gate in
# _find_build_log_blocks, not from vocabulary precision. See process-docs/content_cleaning/ for
# corpus-grep justification (these verbs also occur in ordinary prose, but never in long unbroken
# runs) and for why a stopword-based prose guard was tried on top of this vocabulary and reverted:
# it was built against five invented adversarial fixtures, not one instance of which occurs in
# the 844-file corpus, while it measurably cost real corpus coverage (~6,679 chars of genuine
# noise no longer removed) and roughly doubled this module's size and comment load.
