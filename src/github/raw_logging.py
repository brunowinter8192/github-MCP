# uninterpretable, since the filter keeps changing underneath the corpus.

# FUNCTIONS

# Write the raw, unfiltered fetch text (issue body + comments, exactly as the fetch workflows
# returned them, before strip_noise/strip_comments_noise/strip_generic_noise/strip_build_logs
# touch anything) plus one manifest line recording which cleaning version will process it.
# filename matches the cleaned MD's filename exactly, so raw and cleaned diff by name. Never
# raises — a failed write warns and the caller continues indexing; there is no scenario where a
# missing raw log should block a fetch.
